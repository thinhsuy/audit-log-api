# Code Challenge: Audit Log API

## Objective

Develop a comprehensive audit logging API system that tracks and manages user actions across different applications. This system should be designed to handle high-volume logging, provide search and filtering capabilities, and ensure data integrity and security.

## Requirements:

### Core Features:

#### Audit Log Management:
- **Log Entry Creation**: API endpoints to create audit log entries with metadata
- **Structured Data**: Each log entry should include:
  - User ID and session information
  - Action performed (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, VIEW, etc.)
  - Resource type and ID (e.g., "user", "order", "product")
  - Timestamp with timezone
  - IP address and user agent
  - Before/after state changes (for modifications)
  - Custom metadata fields
  - Severity level (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
  - **Tenant ID**: Multi-tenant support for multiple applications/organizations

#### Search and Retrieval:
- **Advanced Search**: Filter logs by date range, user, action type, resource type, severity, **tenant ID**
- **Full-text Search**: Search through log messages and metadata
- **Pagination**: Handle large result sets efficiently
- **Export Functionality**: Export logs in JSON, CSV formats
- **Real-time Log Streaming**: WebSocket endpoint for real-time log monitoring
- **Tenant Isolation**: Ensure complete data isolation between tenants

#### Data Management:
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies (e.g., keep logs for 90 days)
- **Data Archival**: Move old logs to cold storage
- **Data Compression**: Efficient storage for large log volumes
- **Backup and Recovery**: Automated backup procedures

### Technical Requirements:

#### API Design:
- **API Gateway**: Choose between AWS API Gateway or Application Load Balancer based on requirements
- **RESTful API** following OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based access (Admin, Auditor, User) with **tenant-based access control**
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent API abuse
- **Request Validation**: Input sanitization and validation
- **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages
- **Search Integration**: OpenSearch for advanced search capabilities
- **Multi-tenancy**: Support for multiple tenants with complete data isolation

#### Database Design:
- **Database Choice**: Select one of the three options based on your preference and requirements:
  - **PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB**: Optimized for time-series data with efficient partitioning
  - **MongoDB**: Document-based storage with flexible schema for audit logs
  - **DynamoDB**: Serverless NoSQL with automatic scaling and built-in encryption
- **Multi-tenant Schema**: Design schema to support multiple tenants with proper isolation
- **Optimized Schema**: Design for high-volume writes and complex queries based on your chosen database
- **Indexing Strategy**: Efficient indexes for search operations (database-specific) including tenant-based indexes
- **Data Partitioning**: Consider time-based and tenant-based partitioning for large datasets
- **Connection Pooling**: Handle concurrent requests efficiently

#### Performance:
- **High Throughput**: Handle 1000+ log entries per second
- **Low Latency**: Sub-100ms response times for search queries
- **Message Queue**: AWS SQS for background task processing and data archival
- **Async Processing**: Background tasks for data archival and cleanup using SQS

#### Security:
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive log data at rest
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions for log access with tenant isolation
- **Audit Trail**: Log access to the audit logs themselves
- **Data Masking**: Mask sensitive information in logs (PII, passwords)
- **Tenant Isolation**: Complete data isolation between tenants at all levels
- **Cross-tenant Protection**: Prevent data leakage between tenants

### Implementation Details:

#### Technology Stack:
- **Framework**: Django or FastAPI
- **API Gateway**: Choose one of:
  - **AWS API Gateway** (for serverless, managed API management)
  - **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** (for traditional load balancing)
- **Database**: Choose one of:
  - **PostgreSQL** with TimescaleDB extension (for time-series data)
  - **MongoDB** (for document-based storage)
  - **DynamoDB** (for serverless, scalable NoSQL)
- **Message Queue**: AWS SQS for background task processing
- **Search**: OpenSearch (optional, for advanced search capabilities)

#### API Endpoints:
```
POST   /api/v1/logs                    # Create log entry (with tenant ID)
GET    /api/v1/logs                    # Search/filter logs (tenant-scoped)
GET    /api/v1/logs/{id}              # Get specific log entry (tenant-scoped)

POST   /api/v1/logs/bulk              # Bulk log creation (with tenant ID)
DELETE /api/v1/logs/cleanup           # Cleanup old logs (tenant-scoped)
WS     /api/v1/logs/stream            # Real-time log streaming (tenant-scoped)
GET    /api/v1/tenants                # List accessible tenants (admin only)

```
