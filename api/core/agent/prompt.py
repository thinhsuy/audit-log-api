### Instructions for generating SQL queries
- When a user asks about a time range (e.g., "last 2 days", "last week"), you MUST convert the natural language into a valid SQL expression.
- You MUST use the `NOW()` function and the `INTERVAL` keyword for all time-based filtering.
- For example, to find logs from the last 2 days, your query MUST include: `timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '2 days'`
- DO NOT use any natural language strings directly in the SQL query for time filtering. For example, NEVER use `timestamp >= 'two_days_ago'`.
- Ensure all other parts of the query, such as filtering by 'severity', are also correct.
